SQL Date Format
Why dates are formatted year-first
If you live in the United States, you're probably used to seeing dates formatted as MM-DD-YYYY or a similar, month-first format. 
It's an odd convention compared to the rest of the world's standards, 
but it's not necessarily any worse than DD-MM-YYYY. The problem with both of these formats is that when they are stored as strings, they don't sort in chronological order. 

You might think that converting these values from string to date might solve the problem, but it's actually not quite so simple. 
Mode (and most relational databases) format dates as YYYY-MM-DD, a format that makes a lot of sense because it will sort in the same order whether it's stored as a date or as a string. 
Excel is notorious for producing date formats that don't play nicely with other systems, 
so if you're exporting Excel files to CSV and uploading them to Mode, you may run into this a lot.

Crazy rules for dates and times
Assuming you've got some dates properly stored as a date or time data type, you can do some pretty powerful things. 
Maybe you'd like to calculate a field of dates a week after an existing field. 
Or maybe you'd like to create a field that indicates how many days apart the values in two other date fields are. 
These are trivially simple, but it's important to keep in mind that the data type of your results will depend on exactly what you are doing to the dates.

When you perform arithmetic on dates (such as subtracting one date from another), 
the results are often stored as the interval data typeâ€”a series of integers that represent a period of time.
