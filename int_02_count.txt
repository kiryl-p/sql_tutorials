COUNT is a SQL aggregate function for counting the number of rows in a particular column. 
COUNT is the easiest aggregate function to begin with because verifying your results is extremely simple.

Note: Typing COUNT(1) has the same effect as COUNT(*). Which one you use is a matter of personal preference.

One nice thing about COUNT is that you can use it on non-numerical columns

You might have also noticed that the column header in the results just reads "count." 
We recommend naming your columns so that they make a little more sense to anyone else who views your work. 
As mentioned in an earlier lesson, it's best to use lower case letters and underscores.
You can add column names (also called aliases) using AS
