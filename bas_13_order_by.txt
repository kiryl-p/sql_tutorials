Once you've learned how to filter data, it's time to learn how to sort data. 
The ORDER BY clause allows you to reorder your results based on the data in one or more columns

You can also order by mutiple columns. This is particularly useful if your data falls into categories and you'd like to organize rows by date, for example, 
but keep all of the results within a given category together.

Finally, you can make your life a little easier by substituting numbers for column names in the ORDER BY clause. 
The numbers will correspond to the order in which you list columns in the SELECT clause. 


Using comments
You can "comment out" pieces of code by adding combinations of characters. 
In other words, you can specify parts of your query that will not actually be treated like SQL code. 
It can be helpful to include comments that explain your thinking 
so that you can easily remember what you intended to do if you ever want to revisit your work. 
Commenting can also be useful if you want to test variations on your query while keeping all of your code intact.

You can use-- (two dashes) to comment out everything to the right of them on a given line

You can also leave comments across multiple lines using /* to begin the comment and */ to close it
