NOT is a logical operator in SQL that you can put before any conditional statement 
to select rows for which that statement is false.


Using NOT with < and > usually doesn't make sense because you can simply use the opposite comparative operator instead. 
For example, this query will return an error.

NOT is commonly used with LIKE.

NOT is also frequently used to identify non-null rows, but the syntax is somewhat specialâ€”you need to include IS beforehand
