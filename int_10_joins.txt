Intro to SQL joins: relational concepts

Up to this point, we've only been working with one table at a time. 
The real power of SQL, however, comes from working with data from multiple tables at once. 
Usually, the tables you work with are all part of the same schema in a relational database. The term "relational database" refers to the fact 
that the tables within it "relate" to one anotherâ€”they contain common identifiers that allow information from multiple tables to be combined easily.

Aliases in SQL

When performing joins, it's easiest to give your table names aliases. 
You can give a table an alias by adding a space after the table name and typing the intended name of the alias. 
As with column names, best practice here is to use all lowercase letters and underscores instead of spaces.

Once you've given a table an alias, you can refer to columns in that table in the SELECT clause using the alias name. 

JOIN and ON
After the FROM statement, we have two new statements: JOIN, which is followed by a table name, and ON, which is followed by a couple column names separated by an equals sign.
hough the ON statement comes after JOIN, it's a bit easier to explain it first. ON indicates how the two tables (the one after the FROM and the one after the JOIN) relate to each other.
