SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
LIMIT number

If you write a WHERE clause that filters based on values in one column,
you'll limit the results in all columns to rows that satisfy the condition.
The idea is that each row is one data point or observation,
and all the information contained in that row belongs together.
