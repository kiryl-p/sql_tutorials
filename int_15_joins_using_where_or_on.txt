SQL Joins Using WHERE or ON

Filtering in the ON clause
Normally, filtering is processed in the WHERE clause once the two tables have already been joined. 
It's possible, though that you might want to filter one or both of the tables before joining them. 
For example, you only want to create matches between the tables under certain circumstances.
