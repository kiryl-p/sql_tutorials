Using SQL DISTINCT for viewing unique values
You'll occasionally want to look at only the unique values in a particular column. You can do this using SELECT DISTINCT syntax.

Note: You only need to include DISTINCT once in your SELECT clauseâ€”you do not need to add it for each column name.

DISTINCT can be particularly helpful when exploring a new data set. 
In many real-world scenarios, you will generally end up writing several preliminary queries in order to figure out the best approach to answering your initial question.
Looking at the unique values on each column can help identify how you might want to group or filter the data.

Using DISTINCT in aggregations
You can use DISTINCT when performing an aggregation. You'll probably use it most commonly with the COUNT function.

Okay, back to DISTINCT. You'll notice that DISTINCT goes inside the aggregate function rather than at the beginning of the SELECT clause. 
Of course, you can SUM or AVG the distinct values in a column, but there are fewer practical applications for them. 
For MAX and MIN, you probably shouldn't ever use DISTINCT because the results will be the same as without DISTINCT, and the DISTINCT function will make your query substantially slower to return results.

DISTINCT performance
It's worth noting that using DISTINCT, particularly in aggregations, can slow your queries down quite a bit.
