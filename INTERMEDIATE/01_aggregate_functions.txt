You will use aggregate functions all the time, so it's important to get comfortable with them.
Here's a quick preview:

COUNT counts how many rows are in a particular column.
SUM adds together all the values in a particular column.
MIN and MAX return the lowest and highest values in a particular column, respectively.
AVG calculates the average of a group of selected values.

Aggregate functions are used to perform operations across entire columns 
(which could include millions of rows of data or more).
