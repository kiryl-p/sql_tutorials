SQL FULL OUTER JOIN

The SQL FULL JOIN command
You're not likely to use FULL JOIN (which can also be written as FULL OUTER JOIN) too often, but it's worth covering anyway. 
LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN each return unmatched rows from one of the tablesâ€”FULL JOIN returns unmatched rows from both tables. 
It is commonly used in conjunction with aggregations to understand the amount of overlap between two tables.
