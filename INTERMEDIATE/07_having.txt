The SQL HAVING clause
In the previous lesson, you learned how to use the GROUP BY clause to aggregate stats from the Apple stock prices dataset by month and year.

However, you'll often encounter datasets where GROUP BY isn't enough to get what you're looking for. 
Let's say that it's not enough just to know aggregated stats by month. After all, there are a lot of months in this dataset. 
Instead, you might want to find every month during which AAPL stock worked its way over $400/share. 
The WHERE clause won't work for this because it doesn't allow you to filter on aggregate columnsâ€”that's where the HAVING clause comes in:

Note: HAVING is the "clean" way to filter a query that has been aggregated, but this is also commonly done using a subquery, which you will learn about in a later lesson.

Query clause order
As mentioned in prior lessons, the order in which you write the clauses is important. Here's the order for everything you've learned so far:

SELECT
FROM
WHERE
GROUP BY
HAVING
ORDER BY
