SQL RIGHT JOIN

The RIGHT JOIN command
Right joins are similar to left joins except they return all rows from the table in the RIGHT JOIN clause 
and only matching rows from the table in the FROM clause.

RIGHT JOIN is rarely used because you can achieve the results of a RIGHT JOIN by simply switching the two joined table names in a LEFT JOIN. 

The convention of always using LEFT JOIN probably exists to make queries easier to read and audit, but beyond that there isn't necessarily a strong reason to avoid using RIGHT JOIN.

It's worth noting that LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN can be written as LEFT OUTER JOIN and RIGHT OUTER JOIN, respectively.
